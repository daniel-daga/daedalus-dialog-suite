## 2026-02-01 - Monolithic State vs React Memoization
**Learning:** The `semanticModel` object is a large monolithic state that is recreated on every edit. Passing this entire object to list items like `DialogTreeItem` defeats `React.memo` unless a custom comparator is used to check only relevant sub-properties. Furthermore, callbacks like `buildFunctionTree` that depend on the entire model will break memoization of child components.
**Action:** When working with `semanticModel`, extract stable sub-properties (like `functions` map) for dependencies, and use granular checks in `React.memo` comparators to avoid O(N) re-renders on single-item updates.
